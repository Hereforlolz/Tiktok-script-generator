🚀 AI TikTok Script Generator Pro ✨

Because manually writing viral content is so 2023
🎭 What is this magical creation?

Ever read a tech news headline and thought "this would make a hilarious TikTok if I wasn't terrible at comedy"? Well, now you don't have to be! This bad boy takes real tech news and turns it into ready-to-film viral comedy scripts faster than you can say "algorithm".
💡 Why this exists

Look, we've all been there. You see that Elon tweeted something ridiculous, a startup raised $50M for an app that literally just shows you pictures of toast, or Apple announced they're removing yet another port from the iPhone. Your brain goes "this is comedy GOLD!" but then you sit down to write and suddenly you're just staring at a blank document wondering why you thought you were funny.

Enter: This beautiful chaos machine.

🚀 Getting Started (The "Oh God How Do I Use This" Guide)

This app offers two modes to get you started:
1. ✨ Demo Mode (No Keys Required!)

This is the easiest way to jump in and see the generator in action.

    Open index.html in your browser.

    The app will automatically load sample tech news.

    Select a news story from the "Tech News" panel.

    Choose a "Comedy Format" (e.g., "Tech Dating") and other script settings.

    Click "🎬 Generate Script" or "🎯 Generate Viral Package" to see instant, hardcoded results!

        No API keys, no network calls, just pure, unadulterated demo fun!

2. 🔑 Advanced Mode (Use Your Own API Keys)

For custom news content and real-time AI generation, switch to Advanced Mode.

    Open index.html in your browser.

    Select "Advanced Mode" using the radio button at the top.

    Configure your APIs in the "API Configuration" panel:

        News Source: Choose either "Use NewsAPI.org" (requires a News API Key) or "Use Custom RSS Feed / Website Link".

            For Custom RSS: Provide a direct RSS feed URL (e.g., https://techcrunch.com/feed/). General website links cannot be reliably parsed for articles from the browser due to security policies.

        AI Provider: Select your preferred AI (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere) and enter your API Key if required (Gemini often works without a key in this environment).

    Click "✅ Confirm All Settings". This will enable the main action buttons and attempt to fetch news.

    Fetch News: Click "🔄 Fetch News" to load articles based on your configured source.

    Generate Content: Select a news story and your desired comedy format, then click "🎬 Generate Script", "🎯 Generate Viral Package", or "🖼️ Generate Thumbnails" to get AI-generated content.

Get API Keys:

    News API - For the fresh drama

    Pick your AI poison: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI Studio, or Cohere

🛠️ Tech Stack (For the Nerds)

    Frontend: Pure HTML/CSS/JS (because sometimes simple is better)

    APIs: NewsAPI.org (optional), api.rss2json.com (for RSS parsing, optional), and various AI services (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere - dependent on Advanced Mode configuration).

    Framework: None (we're going old school baby)

    Dependencies: Your sense of humor (not included)

🌟 Features That Make This Not Terrible

⚠️ Warning Labels

    May cause uncontrollable urge to become a TikTok creator.

    Side effects include: increased screen time, questionable dance moves, and explaining internet humor to confused relatives.

    Not responsible for viral fame or subsequent loss of privacy.

    AI-generated comedy may not actually be funny (humor is subjective, fight me).

    Advanced Mode requires valid API keys and may incur costs or hit free-tier limits with external services.
