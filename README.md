# üöÄ AI TikTok Script Generator Pro

*Because manually writing viral content is so 2023*

## What the heck is this?

Ever read a tech news headline and thought "this would make a hilarious TikTok if I wasn't terrible at comedy"? Well, now you don't have to be! This bad boy takes real tech news and turns it into ready-to-film viral comedy scripts faster than you can say "algorithm".

## Why this exists

Look, we've all been there. You see that Elon tweeted something ridiculous, a startup raised $50M for an app that literally just shows you pictures of toast, or Apple announced they're removing yet another port from the iPhone. Your brain goes "this is comedy GOLD!" but then you sit down to write and suddenly you're just staring at a blank document wondering why you thought you were funny.

**Enter: This beautiful chaos machine.**

## What it actually does

- üì∞ **Grabs fresh tech news** (because yesterday's drama is already old news)
- üé≠ **Picks your comedy style** (from "wholesome and silly" to "dark comedy that makes people uncomfortable")
- ü§ñ **Lets AI do the heavy lifting** (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere - basically every AI that'll take your money)
- üìù **Spits out production-ready scripts** (complete with casting notes, props, and timing)
- üéØ **Optimizes for virality** (hashtags, hooks, thumbnail ideas - the whole influencer starter pack)

## Comedy Formats (aka "Characters You Can Pretend To Be")

- üí∞ **Investor Pitch Gone Wrong** - For when you want to roast venture capital
- ü§ñ **AI Therapist** - Because robots giving life advice is inherently hilarious
- üìû **Tech Support Hell** - We've all been there, now monetize the trauma
- üöÄ **Startup Meeting Buzzword Bingo** - "We're disrupting the disruption space"
- üì± **Product Launch Overhype** - "Revolutionary" features that already exist
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Tech Dating Apps** - Romance in the age of algorithms

## Getting Started (The "Oh God How Do I Use This" Guide)

1. **Get API Keys** (Yes, you need to pay for the good stuff):
   - [News API](https://newsapi.org) - For the fresh drama
   - Pick your AI poison: [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com), [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com), [Google](https://makersuite.google.com), or [Cohere](https://cohere.ai)

2. **Open the thing** - Just open `index.html` in any browser (yes, even Internet Explorer if you hate yourself)

3. **Configure APIs** - Paste those keys like you're defusing a bomb

4. **Pick your chaos**:
   - Fetch some spicy tech news
   - Choose your comedy format
   - Set your vibe (millennial angst? gen-z chaos? boomer confusion?)
   - Hit the magic button

5. **Watch the AI work** - It's like having a comedy writer who never sleeps and doesn't demand coffee

## Tech Stack (For the Nerds)

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS (because sometimes simple is better)
- **APIs**: News API + whatever AI service you trust with your jokes
- **Framework**: None (we're going old school baby)
- **Dependencies**: Your sense of humor (not included)

## Features That Make This Not Terrible

- **Multi-AI Support** - Because vendor lock-in is for suckers
- **Live News Integration** - Fresh content that's actually relevant
- **Viral Optimization** - Hashtags, hooks, and thumbnail ideas included
- **Mobile Responsive** - Works on phones (where TikTok lives)
- **No Database** - Everything's client-side, no sketchy data collection

## Warning Labels

- May cause uncontrollable urge to become a TikTok creator
- Side effects include: increased screen time, questionable dance moves, and explaining internet humor to confused relatives
- Not responsible for viral fame or subsequent loss of privacy
- AI-generated comedy may not actually be funny (humor is subjective, fight me)
